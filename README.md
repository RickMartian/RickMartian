### Greetings! It's a pleasure to receive you here! 
I graduated in Information Systems at UNESP. I love cats and to build solutions to people's problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with GenAI, Python and Streamlit at Accenture.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some GenAI stuff like prompting, Langchain, OpenAI, and Autogen.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / His.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Cats can learn a lot of things, but they rarely want to.
