### Greetings! It's a pleasure to receive you here! 
I'm graduated in Information Systems at UNESP. I love cats and to build solutions to people problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Nest.js and Vue.js at Ez.devs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some programming stuff like design patters, better code, clean code and architeture.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / His.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Cats can learn a lot of things, but they rarely want to.
